# known bugs

 * No damage with normals can be delt until each player uses one
 
 * There can only be one fireball on the screen at a time, even with multiple characters with fireballs
 
 * Player sprite stuttering when in contact with other player sprite while jumping

 * No sound for fireball hit (very easy fix)

 * Shoto j.L hitbox not large enough

 * Fireballs do not count towards combo length
